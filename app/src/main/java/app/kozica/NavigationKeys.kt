/**
 * Every route in the app, as a key.

 * **Decide the navigation structure before the first screen.** Routes that exist from the start —
 * even where the screen behind them is still a stub — are what stop navigation from being reverse
 * engineered out of whatever the screens happened to need.
 *
 * Kotlin note: `data object` is a singleton with a sensible `toString`/`equals` — the right shape
 * for a route with no arguments. A route that carries arguments is a `data class` instead, and
 * `@Serializable` is what lets Nav3 save the whole back stack across process death.
