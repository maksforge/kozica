 * device finding rather than a design: Gmail silently ignores `EXTRA_SUBJECT` for `ACTION_SENDTO`,
 * so nothing about the intent fails — the composer just opens with an empty subject, which is the
 * sort of thing found by a user rather than by a build.
 *
 * `Uri.encode` per component, then the pieces concatenated: a `mailto:` URI is **opaque** (there is
 * no `//authority`), so `Uri.Builder` would percent-encode the `?` and `&` that separate the fields
 * and produce one long unparseable opaque part. Encoding each value and joining them by hand is the
 * only shape that survives. `Uri.encode` also writes a space as `%20` rather than `+`, which matters
 * here — RFC 6068 does not read `+` as a space, so a `+`-encoded body arrives full of plus signs.
 *
 * **No `resolveActivity` pre-check.** The manifest's `<queries>` declares the `mailto:` intent so one
 * added later would answer honestly, but the launch itself is already the check — and a pre-check
 * that disagreed with the launch would be a row disabled on a phone that can mail perfectly well.
 *
 * @return whether a mail app opened, so the caller can say so rather than leave a tap doing nothing.
