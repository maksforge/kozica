"""The mark: the single definition of this app's identity.

A Tatra chamois in profile on a crag, both horns hooked back into crooks, and a short tail. Both
generators import it, so the launcher icon, the notification icon and the feature graphic cannot
drift into being different marks. Edit the anchors in `draw-mark.py`, which rewrites MARK and HOLE
here, never the path data by hand.

Two subpaths: the silhouette (animal and crag as one contour) and the hole under the belly.
Coordinates are in arbitrary units around the mark's centre; callers fit them to their canvas with
`fit()`. y grows downward, as in SVG and PIL.
