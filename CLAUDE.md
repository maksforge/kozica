# Kozica

A hiking app for the Polish mountains, built on OpenStreetMap trail data.

- **Vocabulary:** [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — use these terms in code and UI.
- **Decisions and why:** [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — read before changing anything they cover.
- **What's still open:** [`docs/DOD.md`](docs/DOD.md) — the live checklist. **Read this one first.**
- **The arc, in phases:** [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) — sequence only; a phase being built gets
  its own `docs/phase-N.md`. Read the phase you're in, not the file.
- **How to work here:** invoke the `lean-loop` skill at the start of every session and keep it
  active. This repo is written before it is built — plans, ADRs and phase documents are long on
  purpose — so the waste is re-reading what is already in the transcript and testing code whose
  shape has not settled.
- **Commits & releasing:** [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md). Commit subjects **must** be
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `feat!:`, `docs:`, …)
  — a `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else, and release-please derives the version and
  `CHANGELOG.md` from them. `versionName` and `versionCode` are automated; never hand-edit either.

Don't restate ADR reasoning here; link to it. This file is loaded every session and must stay short.

## Working with the person who owns this repo

<Their background, and what to explain rather than assume. For example: "Fluent in
JavaScript/TypeScript, new to Kotlin. Comment code where a Kotlin/Compose idiom has no direct JS
analogue — `Flow` vs promises/observables, `suspend` vs `async`, `remember`/`derivedStateOf` vs
`useMemo`, data class `copy()` vs object spread, sealed classes vs discriminated unions. Explain the
*why*, don't restate the line. Prefer explicit and readable over clever.

The Android **platform** is the other half of the gap and has no JS analogue at all: the manifest as
a declaration the OS reads before any code runs, permission models that differ per API level, process
death, and vendor ROMs overriding documented behaviour. Say when a constraint comes from the platform
rather than from this codebase — that is the difference between "we chose this" and "Android will not
let us do otherwise".">

## Stack

| Choice | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3 | Android only, `minSdk` 26 |
| **Navigation 3** (`androidx.navigation3`) | Replaces Navigation Compose 2.x — don't reintroduce the old one |
| Room via KSP | DAOs return `Flow`; schema evolution per ADR-0001 |
| Manual DI via `AppContainer`, **not Hilt** | Constructor injection is clearer at this size and easy to migrate later |
| Nothing of ours scheduled | Reminders left in phase 0; WorkManager is Play Asset Delivery's alone — ADR-0003's amendments |
| Photo Picker + `TakePicture` intent, **not CameraX** | Far less code; the system camera is fine here |
| Coil 3 images | Compose-native, local files only |
| On-device storage only | No backend. Backup per ADR-0005 |
| MapLibre Native (OpenGL ES) + PMTiles | Offline, every network permission stripped — ADR-0008, `docs/phase-2.md` § 2 |
| Play Asset Delivery | One on-demand pack per Region, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` stripped from its WorkManager — `docs/phase-2b.md` § 1 |

## House rules

- **OpenStreetMap data keeps its ODbL obligations.** Every map screen shows "© OpenStreetMap
  contributors" linked to https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright, and the licences screen lists
  ODbL. Shipping a modified or filtered OSM extract, or publicly conveying maps produced from one, is
  public use of a derivative database: from that first release, offer the database or the script that
  builds it under ODbL (§4.6). The app's own data (tracks, photos, notes) stays an independent
  database, never merged into OSM-derived data. We build OSM data ourselves from Geofabrik extracts,
  never from `tile.openstreetmap.org` or the public Overpass instance. The code's `LICENSE` stays all
  rights reserved.
- **An update never loses a user's data.** Any change to `APP_SCHEMA_VERSION` ships with its
  `MIGRATION_x_y` *registered in* `APP_MIGRATIONS`, the exported `app/schemas/*/N.json` committed, a
  `SchemaGateTest` assertion that the launch gate lets the upgrade through, and a migration test that
  proves the rows survive. `scripts/schema-gate.py` enforces the mechanical half in CI.
  **Every migration test opens the database directly and so walks past the launch gate** — that is
  how an app ships a refusal screen to every existing install with a green test run behind it.
  Verify an upgrade on the phone, not only in a test.
- **A branch merges with every shipped language complete.** Adding an English string does *not*
  redden your build — completeness is a merge gate (`scripts/translation-gate.py`), not a test, so
  copy is translated **once** rather than against draft wording and again after review. Everything
  else about a translation — format arguments, plural categories per CLDR, orphans,
  `translatable="false"` — is `TranslationTest` and holds continuously. Translate from **English
  only**, per [`docs/translator-brief.md`](docs/translator-brief.md).
- **Media paths in the DB are relative** and split by kind — `thumbnails/<uuid>.jpg`,
  `photos/<uuid>.jpg`, `documents/<uuid>.jpg` — resolved against `filesDir` at read time. Absolute
  paths change across installs and break restored backups; the split makes the backup export scopes a
  list of directories.
- **All image writes go through `media/MediaFiles.kt`** — it downsamples and re-encodes per kind,
  bakes in EXIF rotation, strips metadata (GPS included), and writes the file before the row.
  Bypassing it puts full-resolution bitmaps in memory and blows up any image grid.
- **Missing media renders as a placeholder, never a crash.** A restore may legitimately lack files.
- **DAOs return `Flow`**, screens collect it. Don't hand-roll refresh calls.
- **Enums with `TypeConverter`s, not loose strings**, for closed vocabularies. Store enums by
  **name, never ordinal**, so adding a value can't rewrite history.
- One `ViewModel` per screen, UI state as a single immutable data class.
- **Developer-only surface lives in `app/src/debug/`, never in `main/` behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`.**
  With `isMinifyEnabled = false` a statically-false branch is still compiled into the release AAB —
  a hide, not a strip — and its strings are still inside the translation gate. The seam is
  `ui/settings/DebugSettings.kt`, one file per variant, with a no-op in `src/release/`.
- **Colours come from `MaterialTheme`, never literals.** The palette is generated from four seeds by
  `scripts/gen_scheme.py`; edit the seeds and regenerate, never a single role. **The one exception
  is the map style's five Trail colours**, the signposts' own. The style's other colours and its
  sprites are tones of the scheme's palettes, generated by `scripts/map/gen_style.py` and
  `scripts/map/sprites.py`, so after a seed change run those two as well.
- **Spacing comes from `theme/Spacing.kt`.** Six steps on a 4dp grid; no screen invents a seventh.

## Layout

```
app/src/main/java/<namespace>/
  MainActivity.kt, MainApplication.kt, AppContainer.kt, Navigation.kt, NavigationKeys.kt
               the app shell and Nav3 wiring stay at the package root, not under ui/ — they describe
               how the app hangs together rather than any one screen
  AppBackupAgent.kt   Android Auto Backup, taking control of its own file set (ADR-0005)
  data/        Room entities, DAOs, database, converters, migrations, the schema gate, preferences
  data/regions/ every Region's pack and state and what its PMTiles header says; the list itself is
               generated from scripts/regions/ into RegionList.kt
  data/backup/ export, restore, the manifest, the WAL checkpoint
  data/location/ the app's own reader of the phone's fixes; each variant wraps it in
               PositionOverride.kt
  media/       MediaFiles.kt — the single path for persisting images, kind-aware
  theme/       generated palette, type scale, spacing, the night-mode window half
  ui/          Compose screens + ViewModels, one package per area; ui/map/ is Home

app/src/debug/    the developer-only build: the sample-data seeder, Settings' debug section and its
                  strings, the schema-mismatch screen's continue button, SeedReceiver for the
                  capture driver, data/regions/'s RegionSource.kt, which falls back to an archive
                  hand-pushed to files/regions/<id>.pmtiles, and the position override: a long
                  press on the map, Settings' "real position" row and PositionReceiver for
                  scripted readings
app/src/release/  only the other half of each seam, so main/ can call it unconditionally: no debug
                  settings, no continue button, and the Regions and the real position passed
                  through
scripts/          the Python toolchain. project.py is the one place the app's identity lives
scripts/map/      the planetiler profile build-map-data.py runs, decode-tile.py, and the style and
                  sprite generators
scripts/regions/  one boundary polygon per Region
region_<id>/      one on-demand asset pack per polygon in scripts/regions/, all built by
                  gradle/region-pack.gradle.kts; they join the build only with -PmapPacks
art/             mark.py is the identity; both generators derive from it
```

## Versions

Pinned in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`: **AGP 9.0.1, Kotlin 2.3.20, Gradle 9.1.0, Compose BOM
2026.03.01**. `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 36, `minSdk` 26, JDK 21 toolchain.

`compileSdk` stays at **36**: it is the combination AGP 9.0.1 validates against. Bump deliberately,
with a build to prove it.

## Environment notes

- **Two phones, so name one.** Gradle and adb both reach every attached device; set
  `ANDROID_SERIAL` (both honour it) or pass `adb -s <serial>`.
  - **The test phone**, `mnbm7hw8ivdqzx9l`: a wiped, debloated Redmi Note 8 Pro, Android 11 (API
    30), MIUI 12.5, Polish, on USB for good, in airplane mode with no SIM. Location stays on: turning
    it off raises a Play services popup. It has a **pattern lock** (the owner has it), and
    `screencap` returns nothing while the keyguard shows; `svc power stayon usb` keeps it awake and
    unlocked on USB, and `adb shell input keyevent KEYCODE_WAKEUP` wakes it. Drive it at will. The
    map draws on it, unlike the API 26 emulator. `connectedAndroidTest` runs on it with no prompt,
    but its closing uninstall takes the hand-pushed `files/regions/tatry.pmtiles` with it.
  - **The owner's phone**, `132bc856`: a Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G, API 36, HyperOS. Drive it without
    asking whenever adb reaches it (the owner's standing permission since 2026-10-20), but it is in
    use: say so in chat before a reading takes its screen, and restore any toggle afterwards.
- **MIUI optimisation is off on the test phone**, and that is what makes it tap-free. With it on,
  every adb install fails `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`, and the "Install via USB" fix wants a Mi
  account and a SIM. An update can turn it back on, so check before installing:
  `adb shell getprop persist.sys.miui_optimization` reads `false`. The toggle is at the bottom of
  Developer options, revealed by tapping "Reset to default values" a few times.
- **On the owner's phone (HyperOS)**, split-APK installs (`connectedAndroidTest`) prompt on the
  phone and a missed prompt fails the run with `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`; the workaround is
  to install both APKs plain and run the instrumentation directly:
  ```bash
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
  adb install -r -t app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
  adb shell am instrument -w <applicationId>.debug.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
  ```
  **A brand-new `applicationId` is a different failure with the same error string**: HyperOS refuses
  the *first* install of a package outright, with no dialog to miss. Either enable USB installation
  in developer options, or `adb push` the APK to `/sdcard/Download/` and tap it in the file manager.
- **Xiaomi kills background work aggressively.** Anything that must run without the app on screen
  may need battery-optimisation exemption and **autostart**, and autostart is the load-bearing one:
  without it the ROM does not start the process for a broadcast at all. It has no appop, it is a
  Settings toggle, and the grant **lapses on its own** — re-read it before any run that depends on
  it. `scripts/device-gate.py` reads and sets it.
- **A device reading can look identical to a pass when it is nothing at all.** A database pulled
  without its `-wal` sidecar is **stale** — the app's most recent writes sit in the WAL, so a deleted
  row still reads as present. Pull both and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on the host.
